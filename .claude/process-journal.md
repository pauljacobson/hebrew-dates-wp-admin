## Development Log

### 2024-12-31: Project Setup & Skill Creation

#### What I did
- Initialized Git repository for the project
- Created project-specific CLAUDE.md with development guidance
- Created custom Claude Code skill (`hebrew-dates-dev`) to guide development
- Set up process journal for documentation tracking

#### What worked
- Using Claude Code to create a structured skill that will guide the entire development process
- Having reference files for workflow, security, and README template

#### What didn't work
- [Note any issues encountered during setup]

#### What I learned
- Claude Code skills can be project-specific and help maintain consistency
- Documenting as you go is easier than trying to remember everything at the end

#### AI Assistance
- Used Claude Code (Opus 4.5) to:
  - Create the custom development skill with comprehensive documentation
  - Generate reference materials for workflow, security, and README template
  - Set up the process journal structure
